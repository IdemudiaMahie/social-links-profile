## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Variables
- CSS Transition


### What I learned

- I got to practice transition in CSS
```css
button:focus,
button:hover {
    background-color: var(--Green);
    color: var(--Off-Black);
    cursor: pointer;
    font-weight: 800;
    transition: all .9s .3s;
}
```

- I got to practice using true type font.
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: mahieInterFont;
    src: url(./assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt\,wght.ttf);
}
```


### Continued development

- I worked on this project to help re-explain certain areas of css to a friend. It was an interesting project allbeit very simple for me.
